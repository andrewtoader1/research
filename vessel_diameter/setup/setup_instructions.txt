To set up (Mac):

1.) move the mpAnalysis folder into your documents folder on your computer

2.) open 'Terminal' application

3.) type (EXACTLY):
	
	python3 ~/Documents/mpAnalysis/setup/setup.py

4.) type the line(EXACTLY): 

	sudo nano ~/.bash_profile

5.) it will prompt you for a password. This is your user password to your computer. Note that there will be no moving cursor

6.) DO NOT ALTER ANYTHING IN THIS FILE. Scroll down with the down arrow key until you reach the bottom of the text file. In the very last line, type (EXACTLY):

	alias mpa="python3 ~/Documents/mpAnalysis/vesselDiameters.py"
	alias mpa-excel="python3 ~/Documents/mpAnalysis/gatherRoiData.py"

7.) In this exact order, press the keys: 'control + o', then 'enter', then 'control + x'

8.) to test that the setup was successful, quit the terminal (command + q), and reopen it. Type in mpa, and that should prompt you to select a file. If it does, the setup was successful. At this point, quit the program (command + q), and find the 'instructions.txt' file to read the instructions on how to use the program


*Note: in terminal, you cannot move your cursor with your mouse; you must use the side/up/down keys
